## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I realy enjoyed building this page. There are a couple of small challenges hidden in the design that needed a creative solution. These were the colored underlines of the links, the triangle shape on the mobile menu and the colorchange on the bottom SVG's on hover. The biggest challenge was the mobile menu.

### Continued development

The mobile menu needs to be practiced more, but for now I'm happy with the result.
